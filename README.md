# Reverse-Automation-parking-system-using-8051
This GitHub repository contains the source code and design files for a reverse automation parking system using the 8051 microcontroller. The project is designed to automate the process of parking a car in a garage or parking lot.

The system uses ultrasonic sensors to detect the distance between the car and the walls of the parking space, and then uses stepper motors to control the movement of the car. The 8051 microcontroller is used to process the sensor data and send signals to the stepper motors.
